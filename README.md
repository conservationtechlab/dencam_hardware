# Main (current) purpose of this repo

This repo is at this stage mostly created to give us an Issue Tracker
and such for this DenCam hardware work so that we can use that in
concert with the DenCam 2025 Season GitHub project to coordinate on
our work towards both the 2025 deployment and the mid-November Churchill
testing milestones.

There will almost indubitably be related assets that should actually
be under version control and actually belong in here (e.g. Sumega
mentioned that she had made an electrical schematic and it sounds like
that should be under version control and this is a natural place to
put it) but, for at least the time being, I don't think we should
aspire to have documentation for a full recreation of the DenCam
design(s) in here but instead whatever sparse set of documents we
naturally find we need to create and place under version control.
